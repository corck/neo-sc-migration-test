# Neo Python Smart Contract Migration Test

This is an example repo for testing a Smart Contract migration with neo python.

## Contracts

There are two nearly similar contracts that can be imported and executed individually.
Code is base on the neo-python example contracts.

`deploayed-contract.py` is the one that will be imported and migrated to a new contract.
`new-contract` is the one that we want to migrate to.
